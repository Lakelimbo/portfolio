Hello, welcome to my new blog and portfolio.
It's been quite a while since I tried to make one, so now we're here.

If you don't know me, I'm Lakelimbo, but you can call me just Lake.
I work with web development, mostly on front-end, and I also work with graphical design.

I'm also not a native English speaker, so excuse any grammar errors you may find.

Here I intend posting not only reference of works I have done, but also things I'm doing,
 tutorials, among other stuff as well, it will be cool!

# Contact
If you need to contact me right now, the best way is through Discord (Lake#1494).
At the moment I don't intend having first contact via email for some private reasons.
